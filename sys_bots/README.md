## ABOUT SYS BOTS
These bots allow the use of basic system calls in a controlled format.
These bots get access to the "double underscore" operations that handle,
I/O and system stuff.
This allows sys bots to be written in "cell\_bot" syntax, and achieve things
that should be out of reach of non-sys bots to do.

These features will vary between implementations and platforms.
Only basic features like reading and writing files (mostly STDIN/STDOUT) are
being implemented right now.
